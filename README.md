# Template repo for coding projects

Some notes on the file structure:
- routine files have implementations
- run files have simulation structure
    -- these are the files that should be submitted to the cluster for large-scale simulations

Use `sbatch ./dispatch.sh sim0` to run the simulation stored in `sim0_run.R`.
